Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a real-life project can be a bit more complex than using it in a research setting because of the difference in the number of features between the training and deployment stages.

Ways to handle this issue:

Retraining the model: After reducing the dimensionality of the dataset with PCA and training the model, you can retrain the model on the full-dimensional dataset before deploying it in the real-life project. 
This way, the model will be able to handle instances with more features.

Projecting new instances: Once you've obtained the principal components from PCA, you can use them to project new instances with more features into the lower-dimensional space. This can be done by computing the 
dot product of the new instances and the projection matrix, which you can obtain from PCA. However, it's important to keep in mind that projecting new instances into a lower-dimensional space will inevitably lead 
to some information loss.
